## Introduction
This is my proposal for Woovi's challenge. I'm building a refactored version of an app I've coded at
StartSe Tech Academy's Hackathon. The
*[Florestarefa](https://allecosta.github.io/florestarefa/app/main.html)* (portuguse for a play on
words 'forest' and 'task') app is a combination between a to-do list and a LMS system with gamified
elements.

Florestarefa was coded as a front-end PoC using HTML along with Bootstrap 5 and JQuery libraries. I
intend on building a CRUD using React and GraphQL.


*Note: This is HUGE WiP. I'm learning almost everything as I am coding it.*
